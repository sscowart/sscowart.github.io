###Happy February!

We want to thank everyone who came out to our **January 28th meeting at Mean Mug**.  It was our largest attendance in awhile and we received nearly $500 in dues bringing our paid membership to 19!! Let's keep up the momentum and continue to encourage our neighbors to attend meetings and get involved in the 'hood.

####New Board

We introduced our new board and a new structure for delegating ideas.  Please see new titles and task areas for each board member below:

|Member | Task Area| Contact|

|Dan Rose | Collaboration| collaborate@sscowart.com|

####Gettin' stuff done

We also brainstormed new tasks for 2016.  Thank you for all of your wonderful ideas!  Check the site [initiatives page](/initiatives/) for updates on how we're progressing on each of the ideas.

####Please clean up after your pets

This is an ongoing area of concern for neighbors across SouthSide.  We set a precedent 2 years ago when we installed our first dog waste station.  The response has been great and neighbors are using them!  There are waste stations located in Water Tower Park, the roundabout at Cowart & 17th, and the ping-pong park on 14th st. beside the English Tea Room.  There's also a pull bag station on 17th st. across from the fountain park.  We're taking it a step further and putting together a flyer to distribute to neighbors.  We'll need volunteers to help pass them out.  Stay tuned.

####Block Party!

We're brainstorming dates and times for a neighborhood block party this year!  We'll keep you posted.

####Next Meeting
 
April 21st - 6pm - Location: TBA

Thanks for doing your part to keep SouthSide beautiful!
